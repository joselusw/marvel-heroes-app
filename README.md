<h2>Support</h2>

This application has been developer to let people know that Iron-man is, obviusly, the best superhero.

It has a good-looking MVP architecture, retrofit integration, Marvel public API usage and has been coded using Kotlin.

- MVP architecture is IMO the best android way to develop as long MVVM
- Retrofit offers a friendly clear way to perform API calls
- Due to time problems, I focused on main features and some details are still pending. 
- GUI is as clean as possible. Still missing improvments like 'Empty content hints'
- Not a huge fan to mix kotlin & java, therefore there are only 2 java classes.
- It doesn't contain testing cases, which is bound to be changed.

It still can be improved quite a lot, altough main features are working like a charm.

Also an APK can be found on 'Releases' page, if you need to test it.

<h2>Third party library usage</h2>

* Retrofit
* Hdodenhof - CircleImageView
